## **Key Features & Architecture**
### **1. AI Inference Scalability**
Vipas.AI implements **industry-leading techniques** to ensure efficient scaling for AI model execution:
- **Serverless AI Models, Processors, and Agents** (Dynamically Deploy & Evict Models Based on Usage)

- **Horizontal Auto-Scaling** (KServe, Kubernetes HPA, Knative AutoScaler)
- **Vertical Scaling** (Dynamically Increasing GPU & TPU Resources Per Model, Agent, Processor)
- **Scale to Zero** (Serverless Models Spin Down When Idle, Reactivate within seconds)
- **RPS-Based Scaling in Knative** (Requests Per Second-Driven AI Model Scaling)
- **Multi-Cluster AI Model Serving** (Distributes Load Across AI Serving Clusters)
